**Piecewise-linear machine-learning model for motif-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites**

This repository contains the MATLAB code for a piecewise-linear, data-fusion model for
motif-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites. The code was used in
the analysis published in the 2010 article *Genome-wide histone acetylation data improve prediction of mammalian transcription factor binding sites* 
[(Ramsey et al., Bioinform., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq405).

The MATLAB code in this project was written by Stephen Ramsey [(@saramsey)](https://github.com/saramsey) except where otherwise indicated in the header comments.
